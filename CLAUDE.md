# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A Garry's Mod (Lua) addon shipping the `linked_portal_door` entity and a small `wp.*` runtime library. The portal renders one location through another (stencil mask + render-target texture) and optionally teleports anything crossing it. Lives in-place at `garrysmod/addons/world-portals`; no build step — GMod loads the `lua/` tree at server start.

This is the **base layer** other addons build on. The main consumer is `AmyJeanes/Doors` (TARDIS-style doors): it builds exterior↔interior teleporting on `linked_portal_door` and uses `wp.TransformPortal*` for view/velocity transforms. Doors' CI combines both repos into one Workshop upload, so paths here can collide with Doors at upload time (consumer wins) — hence no `addon.json`. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `glua_check` on push/PR to `dev`.

**Publishing a `dev` change to the Workshop is automatic.** This repo has no Workshop upload of its own — the beta addon publishes from Doors' `dev` CI, which bundles the world-portals `dev` it checks out at that time. A green push to world-portals `dev` fires the `trigger-doors` job in `ci.yml`, which dispatches Doors' beta publish (`workflow_dispatch` on Doors `ci.yml`) via the `TOKEN` PAT — skipped when a Doors `dev` build has already run since this commit, so a coordinated Doors push isn't double-published.

## Architecture

### Module layout

`lua/autorun/worldportals_init.lua` is the only entry point: creates the `wp` namespace (one global table), then `wp.LoadFolder("worldportals")` — a folder scanner dispatching each `*.lua` by filename prefix: `sh_` (both realms, AddCSLuaFile'd), `sv_` (server), `cl_` (client, AddCSLuaFile'd). No recognised prefix → silently skipped, so the prefix is **mandatory**. Also `wp.LoadFolder("worldportals/falseworlds", true)` — the `noprefix` form that include+AddCSLuaFile's everything regardless of name (false-worlds extension point; ships only `example.lua`).

**Adding a file under `lua/worldportals/` needs no init edit** — give it a realm prefix and it's picked up. Keep the prefix convention: the loader, the analyzer's realm heuristic, and Doors' own scanner all depend on it. Entities under `lua/entities/` (`linked_portal_door`, `linked_portal_frame`) auto-load via GMod.

### `wp.*` API (in `sh_utils.lua` unless noted)

- `wp.IsLookingAt(portal, portal_pos, view_pos, view_ang, view_fov)` — frustum/cone test to skip off-screen portals.
- `wp.DistanceToPlane(pos, plane_pos, plane_fwd)` — signed distance.
- `wp.TransformPortalPos/Angle(x, portal, exit)` — through-portal transform (WorldToLocal → 180° yaw mirror → LocalToWorld, with `GetExitPosOffset`/`GetExitAngOffset`).
- `wp.TransformPortalVector(vec, portal, exit)` — direction-only (velocity), same pipeline so a real rotation at any pitch/yaw/roll. **The old `exit:GetAngles() - portal:GetAngles()` Euler-subtraction form flipped velocity on floor/ceiling/rolled pairs (the infinite-fall bounce) — don't go back to it.**
- `wp.GetFirstPortalHit(source, dir)` — ray-vs-portal-plane scan over `wp.portals`.

Allocation-free variants in `cl_render.lua` read per-portal cached basis scalars instead of calling engine `WorldToLocal`: `wp.TransformPortalPosInto(out, ...)` / `wp.TransformPortalAngleInto(out, ...)` write into a caller-owned Vector/Angle for hot paths.

**`GetPos` is the wormhole plane, not the visible face.** Teleport crossing (`sh_teleport` crosses the `GetPos` plane), `wp.TransformPortal*`, and the recursive render camera all key off `GetPos`; the visible geometry is the render bounds (`RenderMax.x` = face, `RenderMin.x` = cavity back). Moving `GetPos` shifts the exit view + teleport, and a pair's contributions **add** (move both 5u → 10u shift, they don't cancel) — so to change a portal's visual face/depth without desyncing the pair, adjust render bounds, never `GetPos`.

`cl_render.lua` state: materials `wp.matBlack/matTrans/matInvis/matView2` + `wp.matViewUV`/`wp.uvRemapMatrix` (paint the exit-view RT into the opening); `wp.drawing` (re-entrancy guard set during `render.RenderView`); `wp.rendermode` (true inside `RealRenderView`); `wp.renderparent` (scan-phase: the portal whose exit-view is being filled, nil at top level - the counterpart to draw-phase `wp.drawingent`, which is nil during the scan, so a `wp-shouldrender` veto reads `wp.renderparent` for render direction); `wp.shouldrender(portal, ...)` (visibility decision + `wp-shouldrender` hook); `wp.renderportals(...)`.

`wp.portals` (in `sh_portals.lua`) is a maintained array of live portals — registered from each portal's shared `Initialize`, deregistered via `EntityRemoved`, rebuilt fresh on change (never mutated in place, so a held reference survives mid-iteration), re-discovered on hot-reload. Hot paths iterate it instead of `ents.FindByClass` per tick/frame.

### Entity: `linked_portal_door`

- `shared.lua` — `Initialize` (registers in `wp.portals`), `SetupBounds` (render/collision bounds + the 5 quads for inverted/thick rendering), `SetupDataTables` (networked fields: `Exit`, `Width/Height/Thickness`, `Transparency`, `ZFar`, `Open`, `EnableTeleport`, `Inverted`, `CustomLink`, `ExitPosOffset/ExitAngOffset`, `ModelPos/ModelAng`). Width/Height/Thickness notifies rebuild bounds + (server) the collision-frame hull; `Open`/`EnableTeleport` notifies call `wp.DisarmPortal` when the portal goes closed/non-teleporting so a mid-pass-through prop isn't left no-collided through a now-solid parent.
- `init.lua` (server) — `KeyValue` (Hammer I/O), `Touch` teleports **non-player entities only** (players use the predicted SetupMove path): entry-side `DistanceToPlane` check, `wp-shouldtp` veto, transform pos/vel/angle, ragdoll physics-object pose snapshot/re-apply around `SetPos`, broadcast `WorldPortals_Teleport`. `Touch` also arms the pass-through no-collide for a dynamic/held prop and pre-arms the exit on teleport; `EndTouch` disarms. `RebuildCollisionFrame` (from `Initialize`) creates the `linked_portal_frame` child; `OnRemove` tears it down (unparented, so not auto-removed).
- `cl_init.lua` — `Draw` is the stencil dance. No model (error.mdl marker) → black box or thick quads (`Thickness > 0`); model assigned → `render.Model`. Under `wp.rendermode` (inside another portal's RenderView) it uses the simpler `matView2` path instead of stenciling. Net receives: `WorldPortals_VRMod_SetAngle` (VR yaw), `WorldPortals_Teleport` (mirrors server `SetPos`/`SetAngles` for remote clients; skipped for `LocalPlayer` who predicted it — instead records via `wp.RecordNetTeleport` for the debug HUD).

### Stencil rendering pipeline (`cl_render.lua`) — most fragile piece

Per frame: `render.RenderView` is monkey-patched to first render every portal's exit-view to its RT (recursively; `wp.drawing` guards prevent infinite recursion), then pass through to `RealRenderView`. `wp.renderportals` iterates portals `wp.shouldrender` accepts: push RT → push a clip plane at the exit back-face → compute camera by `TransformPortal*`-ing the view → set `zfar` from portal/exit distance → recursive `RenderView` with `viewid = 1` (`VIEW_3DSKY`, the trick that avoids HUD/postprocess). Phys-gun glow is zeroed during the loop. `RenderScene` calls `renderportals` for the eye view; `PreDrawHalos` returns false while `wp.drawing`. The order and the `wp.drawing`/`wp.rendermode` guards are why nearly every callback checks them first.

Stereoscopy/VR render each eye as its own top-level `render.RenderView`, so portal RTs fill per-eye: `frameRenderedChains` clears per eye, the overlap cull measures in the eye's view `width/height` (not `ScrW/ScrH`, which shifts under a pushed RT), and the d>1 RT pool is partitioned by resolution (a named `GetRenderTarget` is size-locked, so the mono pass and a smaller eye need separate surfaces - sharing one leaked immortal surfaces and crashed). The exit-view RT composites via `render.DrawScreenQuad` in the 3D context (`cl_init.lua`), UV-remapping the eye's slice of the render target and scissoring to the eye rect (a no-op in mono); an eye that passes no `fov` gets the engine's Hor+ aspect-corrected value so the RT projects identically. VR also skips the wasted full-screen desktop pass (`vrmod.IsPlayerInVR()` in `RenderScene`).

### Portals through water

A portal straddling water fills below the waterline with the **same** screen-space `render.DrawScreenQuad` used above it, wrapped in `render.EnableClipping(false)` (capture + restore the prior state) — that defeats Source's water-surface clip, which otherwise slices the near-plane fill away in the refraction pass and once the eye submerges. The water composite reveals it only below the line, so a straddling model cuts at the true waterline for free. `belowWater = rtName == "_rt_waterrefraction" or eyeInWater()` in `cl_init.lua`; the reflection pass is skipped (a mirrored camera can't take the fill). In VR/`pp_stereoscopy` the refraction pass's quad UVs are viewport-local, so it uses an identity UV remap + no scissor there while the main buffer keeps the per-eye remap + scissor.

**Known engine limit (don't re-attempt):** a portal exit *at* a waterline garbles the water **reflection** — the exit clip plane is invalid under Source's mirrored reflection camera, and it can't be corrected or scoped off from Lua (`PushCustomClipPlane` mid-sub-view is a no-op; `r_WaterDrawReflection` is global-only; un-clipping just reflects the hidden shell instead). Same bucket as water when the exit camera is out of bounds — an invalid leaf draws flat `$fogcolor` (reproduces in the main view by noclipping OOB; garrysmod-issues #6536).

### Skybox through portals & out-of-bounds void (`cl_voidsky.lua`)

The 3D skybox is un-clipped around `PreDrawSkyBox`/`PostDrawSkyBox` only (gated `wp.drawing`) — the exit clip plane otherwise slices the engine's small-scale 3D-sky model. Two load-bearing constraints: `viewid = VIEW_3DSKY` in the exit `RenderView` fixes PixVis corruption (sun glints / halos leaking into the main view, garrysmod-requests #467) and must **not** be switched to `0`; and because that viewid makes the engine report `bDrawingSkybox = true` for the real-world opaque pass too, never gate the un-clip on the `bDrawingSkybox` arg (it would turn off the world clip — you'd see the back of the parent through the portal).

When the exit camera lands out of bounds (solid/void) the engine clears black and skips the sky pass, so `cl_voidsky.lua` paints the 2D sky cube itself (six `skybox/<sky>XX` quads, empirically-derived face orientation; `g_sky` procedural skies drawn via the engine's own material) and rebuilds the optional 3D scenery via a `sky_camera` pre-pass into a separate-depth RT blitted as a far-plane billboard. Accepted limits: a full whole-city 3D skybox makes that reconstruction geometry-bound (~48 ms/render); from a solid leaf the engine renders the real in-bounds world near-black with selfillum suppressed (not fixable in Lua — it only reconstructs the sky backdrop).

### Predicted player teleport (`sh_teleport.lua`)

Players teleport in a `SetupMove` hook running in the prediction loop on both realms (LocalPlayer only client-side), so the local view stays in lockstep without waiting for a snapshot. Non-player entities can't be client-predicted (server-authoritative VPhysics) — they stay on `ENT:Touch`.

Per-tick: skip dead/near-zero-velocity; per portal skip closed/no-teleport/no-exit/not-approaching (`velocity:Dot(fwd) >= 0`); fire on a **swept crossing of the `portal:GetPos()` plane** by the eye OR the hull centre (eye is the anti-cull guard — same plane `wp.shouldrender` culls on, so firing here beats the cull; centre catches jump-over and floor-portal cases); in-face bounds check (eye OR centre); `wp-shouldtp` veto.

Then apply, with these hard-won rules — **don't "simplify" them away**:
- `mv:SetOrigin/SetVelocity/SetAngles/SetMoveAngles` + `cmd:SetViewAngles` + `ply:SetLocalVelocity(newVel)` every pass. `mv:SetMoveAngles` is what gamemovement reads for WASD direction — `SetAngles` is the view; without the move-angle rotation the tick after teleport steers along the *old* heading, a lateral kick that stacks per crossing (direction-changing portals skid). `ply:SetLocalVelocity` mirrors the exit velocity onto the entity so momentum-preserving movement (which reads the entity velocity, not the move's) doesn't retain the old world direction; `SetAbsVelocity` no-ops for a predicted player. Safe to re-apply on resim.
- `ply:SetPos(newPos)` **every pass** (server + client first-time AND resim): resets the AbsOrigin interp cache `mv:SetOrigin` doesn't touch, and makes `ply:GetPos()` report the destination before `wp-teleport` runs so a consumer unstick resolves against it. (First-time-only left the origin at the raw transform on resim → high-ping stuck-after-teleport.)
- `ply:SetEyeAngles(clampedAng)` **client-only, first-time-only** (or server-only in singleplayer, which runs no client prediction). It's what actually rotates the camera (`cmd:SetViewAngles` alone no-ops it); the rotated angle rides out in subsequent cmds so the server converges on its own. *First-time only* because it writes a persistent field — re-writing on resim clobbers mouse moved since. *Not server* because a server write makes it authoritative and the snapshot pushes it back ~RTT later, overriding in-flight mouse (confirmed snap-back; a server write was tried and reverted).
- Server branch: VR yaw, `ForcePlayerDrop`, outputs, `wp-teleport`, mv re-sync (re-read `ply:GetPos()` so a consumer relocation survives FinishMove), broadcast.
- Client branch, **every pass**: `wp-teleport` + the same mv re-sync — a consumer unstick (Doors) relocates via `ply:SetPos` inside `wp-teleport` and must re-apply each resim or FinishMove reverts to the raw (often embedded) pos for the ~RTT the crossing command stays unacked. The unstick is a deterministic idempotent resolver, so re-running is safe. **Consumers' `wp-teleport`/`PostTeleportPortal` handlers must be idempotent and resim-safe.**
- Client branch, **first-time only**: arm roll fade (`wp.rotating`), predict-lerp window (`wp.predictedPos/At`), debug record — persistent client-frame state that must NOT re-fire on resim (every resim is the same frame).

**Accepted limits — documented so they're not re-attempted:**
- *High-ping angle contamination.* A predicted teleport at high ping can double-rotate or rotate-and-roll-back the player: client `SetEyeAngles` feeds forward into the next cmds, and prediction tolerance lets the server cross on a *different* command than the client, so the "late" realm reads an already-rotated viewangle. Not cleanly fixable in Lua (predicted DT vars flow server→client only, no clean-angle channel back). Don't retry: the inference fix (reject `view ≈ TransformPortalAngle(stored)`) false-positives on the genuine exit approach and latches a stale angle; the clean fix (carry rotation as a render+movement offset, never rotate `m_angEyeAngles`) needs a global `EyeAngles` override that breaks every consumer's aim.
- *Predict-lerp shift.* `ply:SetPos` doesn't override the engine's snapshot origin lerp: at high ping a pre-teleport snapshot makes `ply:GetPos()` lerp from the old pos for ~RTT (blank-sky frames, wrong frustum origin). Lua can't disable this lerp. Mitigation: `cl_viewcorrections.lua`'s `CalcView`/`CalcViewModelView` shift the camera/viewmodel by `GetNetworkOrigin() - GetPos()` while `wp.predictedPos` is armed, parking the camera at the server-known pos. Use `NetworkOrigin`, not the static `predictedPos` (which freezes the view as the player walks on). Sanity guard: if `NetworkOrigin` is still nearer `predictedOldPos` than `predictedPos` the snapshot hasn't arrived — skip the shift (else it yanks the camera back to oldPos). Disarm is a pure 0.5s `SysTime` timeout — convergence detection failed (engine drift is non-monotonic, so `|delta|` dips below threshold and re-exceeds, firing the disarm early). Use `SysTime`, not `CurTime` (`CurTime` in SetupMove is the future predicted-tick time). `SetRenderOrigin` is a no-op on the local playermodel (works on props), so the local model still lerps — invisible first-person, briefly visible in mirrors.
- *Residual NetworkOrigin stutter.* `NetworkOrigin` isn't interpolated for the local player, so during fast post-teleport motion the camera steps along server ticks (~7u at 500 u/s, converges, no lasting desync). A threshold-gated blend-out would fix it but touches this fragile logic and a naive convergence-disarm already regressed once → left as-is.
- *Noclip re-teleport cooldown.* `FullNoClipMove` discards `mv:SetVelocity`, so the mirrored exit velocity never takes and a same-facing pair (TARDIS) ping-pongs forever. A 0.25s `NOCLIP_TP_COOLDOWN` (resim-safe via `since > 0`) suppresses the immediate re-fire. The thick-volume `backLimit` allowance is also dropped in noclip (no collision to trap a noclipper, so it just reopens the bounce).
- *Deferred — zero-velocity static net.* A player standing dead-still on a floor portal never crosses (the velocity gate + swept test only fire on motion). A static-rest path was scoped but not built; known gap, not a regression.
- *Lateral drift entering a parent's doorway — not the crossing.* Walking into a parent's opening at an oblique angle can slide the player sideways enough to miss it. It's the engine's `ClipVelocity` deflecting the hull off the parent's threshold/ramp collision on approach (worse off-square; the lip's brief airtime removes the ground friction that would otherwise straighten it) — the crossing transform neither causes nor fixes it, and it reproduces with the predicted path fully removed. It belongs to whoever owns the doorway geometry, and isn't fixable here short of re-projecting the player's velocity in the predicted path (fragile, rejected). Don't re-investigate the crossing for it.

### Portal ghosts (`cl_ghosts.lua`) — continuous entity rendering

Client-only visual layer so an entity straddling a portal reads as one body instead of being cut off at the opening. Renders **two clipped halves**: the real entity (`RenderOverride` clipping to `+entry_forward`) and a clientside **ghost** (`ClientsideModel`, flagged `WPIsGhost`) at the mirror-transformed exit pose clipping to `+exit_forward`. The seam sits on the portal's visible face (`FACE_OFFSET` + `thickness`), not the crossing plane behind it. Decoupled from the teleport — straddling is a per-frame geometry test (`straddles`: cheap OBB-centre-in-opening, plus a 12-edge OBB-vs-plane clip for long/off-axis props).

- **Discovery** on a throttled `Think` (~25 Hz): `ents.FindInSphere` per open teleport-enabled portal — radius padded by `reachOf` (`OBBCenter():Length() + BoundingRadius()`) on *both* the portal and the largest tracked candidate, since `FindInSphere` culls on origins and an origin can sit far from the geometry that matters (a ladder's is at one end; a portal's box sits behind its face). Candidate reach is cached per entity (weak-keyed `reachByEnt`), `maxReach` recomputed only when an at-max entity leaves, with a `REACH_FLOOR` so a straddling player/NPC/ragdoll is caught when no larger prop set the max. Gated by `isCandidate` (prop_physics/ragdoll/NPC/player incl. local; skips dead players, our ghosts, and NoDraw'd props - a NoDraw'd prop would ghost as a bodiless emerged half) and `wouldTeleport` (the same `wp-shouldtp` veto — position-independent, the right "portal off" signal; NOT `wp-shouldrender`, which is view-dependent and would vanish the ghost inside an interior).
- **Pose + clip planes** are recomputed **per draw inside the `RenderOverride`**, not in a per-frame hook: a ghost only ever draws in the portal RT passes (portals render under `VIEW_3DSKY`), so a `PreDrawOpaqueRenderables` pose would miss the very pass it's drawn in and lag a fast-moving portal. Each override computes the one clip plane it consumes — `updateEntryPlane` on the real entity, `updateExitPlane` on the ghost — reading the original's *render* transform (so it lands after `cl_renderfollow` finalises it). Rigid props: `poseGhost` (`SetPos`/`SetAngles`) then `SetupBones` (`DrawModel` renders from bone matrices the engine built off the *pre-override* transform, so `SetPos` alone wouldn't move the draw). Skeletal (ragdoll/NPC/player): per-bone via `copyBonesThroughPortal`, which composes the portal transform once as a `VMatrix` (`exitFrame * yaw180 * entryFrame:GetInverseTR()`) and applies `M * GetBoneMatrix(i)` per bone — also inside the `RenderOverride` because `SetBoneMatrix` is consumed by the next `DrawModel`. The throttled scan also calls `poseGhost`, but only to keep the ghost's cull bounds current between draws. A held weapon is mirrored as a second sub-ghost.
- **Records** (`wp.ghosts[ent]`) carry a 0.1s anti-flicker grace, are re-pointed to the new pair the instant the entity teleports (the `wp-teleport` hook updates `rec.portal/exit` before render, killing a one-frame flicker), and tear down on expiry/`EntityRemoved` (restoring the saved `RenderOverride`). `wp.IsGhosting(ent)` reports whether a record exists - a consumer that also drives the entity's `RenderOverride` (Doors' cordon) yields the slot while it's true.
- **Local player:** ghost is the emerged half, shown in third-person/external/RT/recursion, suppressed only in the view looking straight through the transited portal (`localGhostIsCutaway`). Player colour via overriding `GetPlayerColor` on the ghost (`SetPlayerColor` errors on a `ClientsideModel`).
- Convars `worldportals_ghosts` (master) / `worldportals_show_self` (own body; created in `cl_render.lua`, also gates `ShouldDrawLocalPlayer` so off = no self-reflection in RTs). Consumer hook `wp-shouldghostdraw` under Conventions.

### Rapid-loop interp bypass (`cl_renderfollow.lua`)

A non-player prop teleporting twice within `RAPID_WINDOW` (a tight floor↔ceiling loop) renders at its live `GetNetworkOrigin/Angles` instead of the engine's `cl_interp` history (which resets each teleport and freezes the prop into an ~8 Hz stutter) — snapping on entry, easing back on exit. Armed off `wp-teleport` (client, players excluded); applied in a `Think` over `wp.renderFollow`; `cl_ghosts` pose reads the `SetRenderOrigin` it sets. Accepted limit: a prop leaving the loop still moving gets a brief freeze.

### Trace redirection (`sh_teleport.lua`)

1. **`EntityFireBullets`** — bullets toward a portal get `data.Src`/`Dir` rewritten exit-side, `data.IgnoreEntity` set from `wp-tracefilter`; return `true` so the engine uses the modified data.
2. **`util.TraceLine` monkey-patch** — `util.RealTraceLine` captures the original; `WorldPortals_TraceLine` re-traces from the exit if a portal sits between start and hit. Re-installed in `InitPostEntity` to win the race against addons that also replace `util.TraceLine`.

The monkey-patch is **global** — every consumer's traces go through it. Be deliberate; silent regressions hit every addon.

### Server: PVS & pairing (`sv_render.lua`)

- `SetupPlayerVisibility` adds the exit origin to PVS for anyone who can see the entry — the only way GMod allows the out-of-PVS exit scene to render (else the RT draws empty).
- `PairWithExits` (at `InitPostEntity` + `PostCleanupMap`) sets each portal's exit by partner name if invalid — Hammer load order isn't guaranteed.

### Server: portal-aware collision (`sv_collision.lua`, `linked_portal_frame`)

A portal is usually parented to a solid structure (e.g. a shell), and the teleport only fires once a prop's centre crosses — so a big prop jams on that parent first. Two server pieces fix it (no collidable ghost exists — a clientside entity can't block server props); with the visual ghosts, a prop reads as passing through.

**Pass-through no-collide.** While a dynamic/held prop touches an open teleport-enabled portal (armed from `ENT:Touch`, event-driven), it's `constraint.NoCollide`d with the solids `wp-nocollide` returns, disarmed on `EndTouch`/close/disable/removal. State: `wp.nocollide[ent][portal]`; API `wp.ArmNoCollide`/`DisarmNoCollide`/`DisarmAllNoCollide`/`DisarmPortal`. Phase solids = exactly what `wp-nocollide` returns — the consumer owns the decision (its structure may not be engine-parented to the portal); omitting an entity keeps it solid (default-solid), so a missed one jams the prop rather than voiding it. Two sharp edges: (1) the already-armed check runs **before** `eligible()`, because the NoCollide makes the prop appear in the parent's constraint network and would fail the contraption guard on re-arm; (2) the `NoCollide` is created with `disableOnRemove = true` (5th arg) so a bare `:Remove()` re-enables the pair — without it, `:Remove()` leaves the VPhysics pair disabled forever (silent permanent ghosting). A sleeping prop isn't re-tested by triggers, so a portal moving out from under one never fires its `EndTouch`; a `Tick` handler wakes armed props whose portal moved so the trigger re-evaluates and disarms them.

**Collision frame (`linked_portal_frame`).** Invisible server-built perimeter hull (`FrameSlabs` → 4 box slabs via `PhysicsInitMultiConvex`) funnelling a transiting prop through the opening while the parent is "removed" for it. `COLLISION_GROUP_WEAPON` (hits props, not players — players keep their predicted path), no `EnableCustomCollisions` (physics-vs-physics suffices; ECC would block bullet/use traces). Created/resized by `RebuildCollisionFrame`/`BuildFrame`. Two verified choices:
- **Unparented** — a parented frame would be a descendant of the parent, so the prop↔parent no-collide would phase the frame the instant a prop armed. Unparented, it follows via its own `Think`; `wp.NoCollideFrame` re-adds the frame↔parent no-collide it loses (else the solid hull interpenetrates the parent and the solver shoves it), **parent-only** so it doesn't grab an armed transiting prop. `BuildFrame` recreates the physobj, which orphans that no-collide (a `logic_collision_pair` fires its disable once and never reapplies, and stays valid so `NoCollideFrame`'s IsValid check won't replace it) — so `BuildFrame` drops + re-adds it. (Tested: the orphaned state doesn't shove a *settled* parent, but it leaves collision silently wrong and would push the parent if the orphaned frame then moves.)
- **Physics shadow, not a static body** — `MakePhysicsObjectAShadow(false,false)` + per-tick `UpdateShadow`, so a moving portal **pushes** props in the doorway; a static `SetPos`'d hull flung them. A single-tick jump past `SHADOW_TELEPORT_DIST` can't be swept, so it snaps.

Client half of the frame is debug-only: `worldportals_debug_collision` draws the slabs (rebuilt client-side from networked dimensions).

### Client: view roll, predict-shift, stair-strip (`cl_viewcorrections.lua`)

A combined `CalcView` hook does three things, all mirrored onto the viewmodel via `CalcViewModelView` (so the physgun/hands ride with the camera), both bailing when `GetViewEntity() ~= ply` (leave camera/monitor views alone):
(a) **roll fade** — `math.Approach`es `wp.rotating` (armed by the SetupMove path / `wp.ArmTeleportView`) to 0 so the world doesn't snap-rotate on landing;
(b) **predict-lerp shift** — see Predicted player teleport above;
(c) **stair-strip** — subtracts the engine's `SmoothViewOnStairs` eye-Z easing (measured as `pos.z - EyePos().z`, stashed in `wp.stairLeak`) for a brief window after a grounded portal exit, so the landing's big Z change isn't read as one huge stair step.
Roll fade + stair strip arm in **both** realms (the singleplayer net handler calls `wp.ArmTeleportView`); the predict-shift is prediction/ping-only (nil in singleplayer). Removing the roll fade alone is fine; removing the predict-shift reintroduces the blank-sky frame at high ping.

### Client: predicted-teleport debug HUD (`cl_predictdebug.lua`)

Developer HUD behind `worldportals_debug_predict` (default off). Buffers the last few predicted teleports (`wp.RecordTeleportEvent` from `sh_teleport.lua`) + the last self-broadcast pos (`wp.RecordNetTeleport`) and renders per-frame ply state, predict-lerp panel, and nearest-portal swept-test inputs — useful on paused frames. Record calls are guarded (`if wp.RecordTeleportEvent then`) so the file is a clean delete; the counters it reads live in `cl_viewcorrections.lua`/`sh_teleport.lua` so removing it can't break the predict path.

### Optional integrations

- **`vrmod`** — only behind `if vrmod then`; stub at `.luatypes/vrmod.lua` (`IsPlayerInVR`, `GetOriginAng`, `SetOriginAng`). VR users get a yaw-offset on teleport.
- **No CPPI, no WireLib.**

## Conventions when adding code

- **Realm-prefix filenames** (`sh_`/`sv_`/`cl_`). Suffixes break the analyzer's realm heuristic.
- **Monkey-patching engine globals** (`util.TraceLine`, `render.RenderView`): capture the original under a `Real*` alias once, and reinstall in `InitPostEntity` so later-loading addons don't clobber it.
- **Consumer hooks** all use `hook.Call(name, GAMEMODE, ...)`: `wp-shouldrender`, `wp-trace`, `wp-tracefilter`, `wp-shouldtp`, `wp-teleport`, `wp-allowthickportal`, `wp-shouldghost`, `wp-shouldghostdraw`, `wp-nocollide`, `wp-predraw`/`postdraw`, `wp-prerender`/`postrender`. Don't change the calling convention without updating Doors (it hooks all of these).

Hook contracts that bite if misused:
- **`wp-shouldghost(portal, ent)`** (client) — candidacy veto for the emerged-half ghost: return `false` to never ghost `ent`. Distinct from `wp-shouldghostdraw` (per-render-pass draw visibility on an already-created ghost). Ghosting also honours `wp-shouldtp`, so ghost and teleport share the same "portal off / not this entity" answer; use `wp-shouldghost` only for a ghost-specific exclusion. Runs client-side, so its veto (like `wp-shouldtp`'s) must be client-evaluable.
- **`wp-shouldghostdraw(sourceEnt, ghostEnt, portal, exit)`** (client) — fired **inside the ghost's `RenderOverride`, once per render pass**; return `false` to skip drawing in that pass. For an exit in a region hidden from the open world (a TARDIS interior in the skybox), the ghost must draw only in that region's RT pass, not the main scene. **Must not be cached** — the answer differs between the main-scene pass and each RT pass in one frame. Doors routes it (via `exit:GetParent()`) to a `ShouldDrawGhost` interior hook. Deliberately does NOT touch the `SetNoDraw` cordon (reserved for engine-native props).
- **`wp-shouldtp` + `wp-teleport` fire on both realms** for predicted player teleports (from `SetupMove`). `wp-shouldtp` once per crossing; `wp-teleport` on the client **every prediction pass (first-time AND resim)** (server fires it once per command). The client re-fires so a consumer's position fix re-applies each resim — so **handlers must be idempotent and resim-safe** (no sounds/effects/counters; pure deterministic resolvers only). Register the hooks **shared** (Doors moved `wp-shouldtp` out of `if SERVER`). Inner `CallHook` chains can stay server-only and return nil client-side; the client optimistically allows, server is authoritative.
- **`wp-nocollide(portal, ent)`** (server) — return the complete list of solids the transiting prop may phase through; world-portals no-collides exactly that, skipping the prop itself / ghosts / portals / frames and anything without a physics object. The consumer owns the decision — omitting an entity keeps it solid, so a missed one merely *jams* a prop (recoverable) instead of dropping it into the void. Field contract: `ent.WPIsGhost == true` = a clientside ghost (collision + ghost passes skip it); don't repurpose it.
- **`wp-prerender`/`wp-postrender`** fire as `(portal, exitPortal, plyOrigin, depth)` (1 = top-level, 2+ = nested). A consumer that saves/restores global render state across the pair MUST guard on `depth > 1` to skip nested renders, or a nested pre-render clobbers the parent's saved state before its post-render restores.

## API reference wiki (`scripts/generate-wiki-api.ps1`)

The type-reference pages in the sibling `world-portals.wiki` repo are generated from `---@class` / `---@field` annotations. The `linked_portal_door` entity keeps its runtime name; the documented struct types use the public `worldportals_` prefix (`worldportals_false_world`, `worldportals_false_world_part`). The shared `gmod-addon-tools` module owns the renderer; `scripts/generate-wiki-api.ps1` is a thin driver and `scripts/wiki-api.config.ps1` is the reusable category/owned-prefix config that lets other generated-wiki addons link these `worldportals_` types automatically when this repo appears in their `.luarc.json` workspace libraries.

## Tooling

`.luarc.json` configures `glua_ls`/`glua_check` (both EmmyLua-Analyzer-Rust) with `./.tools/glua-api` (GLua stubs) and `./.luatypes` (local overrides + the `vrmod` stub). VS Code extension: `Pollux.gmod-glua-ls`.

### Type annotations

- **Trace redirection (`sh_teleport.lua`).** `util.RealTraceLine` returns a `TraceResult`, not the input `Trace`. The result is named `trace`, but `mask`/`filter` come off the input `data` — keep that straight; `trace.mask`/`trace.filter` would read fields a `TraceResult` lacks.
- **Field-access narrowing doesn't propagate.** `if not (data.Src and data.Dir) then return end` does NOT narrow `data.Src`/`Dir` below. Copy each into a local, null-check the locals on separate lines, then use the locals.
- **Trace struct casts.** Inline tables passed to `util.TraceLine`/`RealTraceLine` may not match the `Trace` struct (partial narrowing); an inline `--[[@as Trace]]` cast is cleaner than restructuring when the logic is correct.
- **`.luatypes/`** — local LuaLS stubs. `glua_overrides.lua` aliases the integer enums (`COLLISION_GROUP`, `FORCE`, `STENCILOPERATION`, `STENCILCOMPARISONFUNCTION`; glua-api ships them as string-literal unions that break `SetCollisionGroup(COLLISION_GROUP_WORLD)`), adds the 2-arg `table.insert(tbl, value)` overload, and declares `WPTraceResult` (non-nil trace view, see below). `ModelInfo` extends the GMod `util.GetModelInfo` return stub with render-bound corners. `vrmod.lua` declares the VR globals. Addon-owned API types live inline beside their definitions, not in `.luatypes`.

**`diagnostics.disable` in `.luarc.json` is empty — every rule is on, including glua_ls 1.0.20+'s flow-based nil analysis (`need-check-nil`, `unchecked-nil-access`).** That analysis floods false positives on GMod's runtime-set entity fields, engine struct returns, and iterator element types, so the suite kept it disabled for a while; world-portals now clears all of them at the source with type annotations rather than suppressing the rules. When you add code that hits one of these boundaries, follow the same pattern (don't reach for `diagnostics.disable`):

- **Portal entities** carry runtime render-cache fields (`WP*`) and `AccessorFunc` methods the analyzer can't see. They're declared inline on `---@class linked_portal_door : Entity` at the top of `lua/entities/linked_portal_door/shared.lua`; type portal arrays/params as `linked_portal_door` (e.g. `wp.portals`). glua_ls resolves `NetworkVar` accessors itself but NOT `AccessorFunc` ones - add a new `WP*` field or `AccessorFunc` to that inline class or the strict type trips `undefined-field`.
- **Engine struct returns** (`TraceResult.HitPos`/`Normal`/`StartPos`) are `= nil` in glua-api despite their `---@type`, and the flow analysis reads the literal `nil`. A `.luatypes` re-declaration does NOT override it (class defs merge; verified for `---@field` and value-reassignment). A populated trace is `---@cast trace WPTraceResult` (non-nil subclass in `glua_overrides.lua`) - the cast context honours the subclass field where the merge doesn't.
- **Multi-return** (`local mins, maxs = ent:GetCollisionBounds()`) flags the trailing value nilable even though the stub returns two non-nil Vectors. Re-assert with a typed local: `---@type Vector, Vector`.
- **Iterator element types** - glua-api's `ipairs`/`pairs` stubs return a bare `function`, dropping the element type, so a typed container's loop var is loose and an element `---@class` never binds. Overriding the stubs generically does NOT win (library-vs-library merge). `---@cast v <Class>` the loop variable inside the body (the analyzer drops the cast across a nested-`if` join, so place it at the flagged access, not just the loop top).
- **Record tables** (`wp.ghosts`, the debug event buffer, false-world parts) get a `---@class` + a typed container (`---@type table<Entity, wp.GhostRecord>`) or a typed `---@param`; a finding flowing through a function parameter clears cleanly that way.

<!-- >>> GENERATED shared conventions (gmod-addon-tools) - do not edit; regen: scripts/generate-claude-md.ps1 >>> -->

_Shared conventions for my GMod addons - generated from [`gmod-addon-tools/docs/gmod-addon-conventions.md`](https://github.com/AmyJeanes/gmod-addon-tools/blob/main/docs/gmod-addon-conventions.md). Edit it there, not in this file; the block below is overwritten by CI. Addon-specific guidance lives outside the markers._

## Code style

- **Pure Lua syntax only - no GMod-Lua extensions.** No `//` comments, no `continue`, no `!=`, no `&&`/`||`. Use `--`, `goto continue`, `~=`, `and`/`or`.
- **Comments: concise, the _why_ not the _what_.** A couple of lines at most; reserve length for genuinely non-obvious rationale and bias toward cutting - match the surrounding density, don't pad to essay length. Don't restate the code, don't explain it by what it replaced, and keep the _why_ self-contained (no pointers to external docs or fragile cross-file references). Keep comments ASCII: `->` not an arrow, a single spaced hyphen for a dash (never a double `--`, which reads as a second comment marker, nor an em-dash).
- **Drop the loop variable you don't use** rather than naming it: `for _, v in pairs(t)`, `for k in pairs(t)`, `for _ = 1, n do`. The `unused` lint is on - keep the noise floor at zero.
- **Every `---@diagnostic disable` needs a paired reason** on the same or preceding line naming _why_ the rule is suppressed. The default is to fix the issue, not suppress it.

## First-time setup (before touching `.lua` files)

The tooling (`glua_check`, `glua_ls`, the GLua API stubs, and the wiki/typing type-model) is provisioned by the shared [`gmod-addon-tools`](https://github.com/AmyJeanes/gmod-addon-tools) module, cloned **beside this addon**. `scripts/install-tools.ps1` is a thin wrapper - `scripts/bootstrap.ps1` resolves the sibling module and it calls `Initialize-GmodTools`, so the version pins live once in the module and every addon runs the exact same engine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmyJeanes/gmod-addon-tools ../gmod-addon-tools
pwsh -File scripts/install-tools.ps1
```

It is idempotent - re-running is a no-op when the pinned versions are already present, so it is also the recovery path when diagnostics look wrong. After a fresh install, run `/reload-plugins` so Claude Code re-launches the LSP against the new binary.

## Claude Code LSP integration (`glua-lsp` plugin)

Diagnostics, hover, and jump-to-definition come from the [`glua-lsp` plugin](https://github.com/AmyJeanes/gmod-claude-plugins) (marketplace `AmyJeanes/gmod-claude-plugins`), which wraps the [`glua_ls`](https://github.com/Pollux12/gmod-glua-ls) server - the same EmmyLua-Analyzer-Rust engine as `glua_check`, running long-lived. Diagnostics arrive automatically after every edit; no hook involvement. `.claude/settings.json` declares the marketplace so contributors get prompted to install on first open, and the plugin auto-resolves `glua_ls` from this project's `.tools/bin/` at launch (no global install, no PATH plumbing). The `glua-lsp:install-glua-ls` skill covers the same recovery flow if symptoms appear later. Treat reported diagnostics as actionable only if your edit caused them - pre-existing noise on unrelated lines is not in scope for the current change.

## Whole-repo scans (`scripts/glua-check.ps1`)

`glua_ls` only analyzes files as they are opened or edited. To audit the whole repo at once, run `pwsh -File scripts/glua-check.ps1` - it provisions tooling on demand (no-op when present) and runs `glua_check --warnings-as-errors` against the workspace root. It takes no path filter, so it always scans everything; CI runs the same script. Useful after a fix ripples across the tree, or when picking the project up to surface latent issues the LSP hasn't opened yet.

## Typing enforcement (`scripts/typing-check.ps1`)

`glua_check` catches _wrong_ types but not _missing_ ones - an untyped param is a silent `any` it never flags. `Test-GmodTyping` (CI: `typing-check.yml`) closes that gap, failing the build on any of: an untyped param, annotation rot (a `---@param` for a param that no longer exists), a modeled function whose resolved return type contains `unknown`, a hook fire-site argument that resolves to `unknown`, or a `:CallHook`-style hook whose receiver resolves to `unknown` (so its "Fired on" column would render _Unknown_ - usually fixed with a `---@param self <class>` on the enclosing function). Satisfy it at the **source** - prefer a `---@param` / `---@return` / `---@class` annotation over a per-callsite `---@cast`, since annotations propagate to every caller. The only accepted escapes are explicit and greppable: `---@param x any` (a reviewed, genuine `any`), an `_` discard for a deliberately-unused arg, and a file-level `---@vendored` marker on third-party code.

Where an addon fires its own hooks, callback payload params are typed by a generated `---@overload` catalogue (`scripts/generate-hook-types.ps1`, CI: `generate-hook-types.yml`) - do not hand-edit it; retype a payload at its `CallHook` / `hook.Run` site instead. Custom global-hook overloads are spliced into the provisioned `hook.lua` by `Initialize-GmodTools`, so after pulling a change to a generated fragment mid-session, re-run `scripts/install-tools.ps1` (it re-syncs) then `/reload-plugins` to refresh live types.

## Bumping the shared tooling

Tool versions and this conventions block are pinned to a `gmod-addon-tools` tag. Bump the version constants in `gmod-addon-tools/src/install.ps1` (or edit the shared docs); merging to the module's `main` auto-cuts a new tag, and Renovate then raises a pin-bump PR here that regenerates the affected artifacts and runs GLua Check before it merges. CI pins the module by tag (the `ref:` in each workflow); a local sibling checkout uses whatever branch it is on, so keep it on the pinned tag to mirror CI exactly.
