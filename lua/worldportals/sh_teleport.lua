-- from input every tick — see backLimit note below), so a player keeps their
-- pre-teleport WORLD velocity. When entry+exit face similar world directions
-- (a TARDIS pair) that velocity points back into the exit's face, re-crossing
-- before the per-teleport view rotation (which DOES apply) can redirect them:
-- the forward and reverse rotations cancel on alternating ticks and the velocity
-- never escapes, so the player ping-pongs. The exact landing varies with
-- geometry — inside the shell (same-facing pair) or in front of the exit face
-- (pitched pair) — so no single back-face tweak catches them all. Instead, once
-- a noclip teleport fires, suppress the next one briefly: that lets the single
-- surviving view rotation steer the velocity out over the following ticks, so
-- the player flies clear (a clean one-shot transit each way). 0.25s clears the

    --     portal:GetPos()) stops the stencil and the world shows through before
    --     the teleport lands. So the eye is the anti-cull / anti-bounce front
    --     guard (the distNow <= backLimit gate below), and one of the two points
    --     whose plane-crossing can fire the teleport.
    --   * the hull CENTRE drives the face bounds, and is the SECOND crossing
    --     point. We fire when EITHER the eye or the centre reaches the plane.
    --
    -- Why both, not the eye alone: the eye sits a fixed ~28u straight ABOVE the
    -- centre (purely vertical — measured), so along a portal's normal the two
    -- differ by 28 * forward.z, i.e. only the portal's PITCH matters, never yaw:
    --   * upright/vertical portal (forward.z ~= 0): eye and centre are at the
    --     same depth, so "either crosses" is bit-for-bit the old eye-only test —
    --     no change to the common wall portal at any yaw.
    --   * ceiling / downward-pitched (forward.z < 0): the eye LEADS (going up
    --     into the plane the highest point crosses first), so it still fires
    --     first and the centre term never triggers earlier — also unchanged.
    --   * floor / upward-pitched (forward.z > 0): the centre LEADS. The eye is
    --     the highest point, so against an up-facing portal it crosses LAST — and
    --     when you rest on whatever's under the opening (e.g. a TARDIS shell) your
    --     feet stop before the eye ever reaches the plane, so an eye-only test
    --     can't fire while standing and only fires deep/late on a fall. Firing on
    --     the centre catches the body crossing mid-fall, retaining entry velocity.
