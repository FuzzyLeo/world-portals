-- Portal-aware collision for transiting props.
--
-- A portal is usually mounted flush against a solid entity (a TARDIS exterior
-- shell, its door parts, an interior back wall). The teleport only fires once a
-- prop's centre crosses the portal plane (init.lua ENT:Touch), so a decent-sized
-- prop pushed at the portal jams on that wall before it can cross. While a prop
-- is touching an open teleport-enabled portal we no-collide it with the wall
-- entities (via constraint.NoCollide), so it passes through instead of jamming.
-- The portal's collision frame (linked_portal_frame) keeps it funnelled through
-- the opening cross-section while the wall is "removed" for it.
--
-- Arming is driven by the portal's trigger Touch (the portal is a SetTrigger
-- entity), not a per-tick proximity scan: Touch is event-driven and only fires
-- for entities actually overlapping the doorway, which is far cheaper on a base
-- addon everything sits on. Touch (not StartTouch) so a portal that opens around
-- an already-present prop still arms it.
--
-- The ghosts (cl_ghosts.lua) make this read continuously; this file is the
-- physics half. There is intentionally NO collidable ghost: a clientside entity
-- can't block server props and there's no per-face collision carving, so we make
-- the real prop pass through the wall rather than fake a solid ghost.

-- actually no-collided if it OPTS IN with `ent.PortalNoCollide == true`.
--
-- Opt-in (default solid) is deliberate: a portal's parent can be a large interior
-- model, and no-colliding it by default would let a transiting prop fall through
-- the whole interior into the void. So the consumer explicitly flags exactly what
-- should be phased -- the shell the portal is mounted on, the entry wall -- and
-- everything else (floor, decor, the interior model itself) stays solid. A missed
-- flag just jams the prop (recoverable); it can never drop it into the world.
-- Never the portal or its frame (the frame must keep bounding the prop) nor the
-- prop itself, and only entities with a physics object (NoCollide needs one).
