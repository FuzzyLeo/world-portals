-- Continuous entity rendering across portals ("portal ghosts").
--
-- An entity physically straddles a portal's plane for a short window before the
-- teleport fires (props: server ENT:Touch; players: predicted SetupMove). The
-- already-crossed half is otherwise visually cut off: eaten by the portal hole
-- on the entry side, and popping out of nothing (you see its backfaces) on the
-- exit side. We render the straddling entity as TWO clipped halves so it reads
-- as one continuous object spanning the pair:
--
--   * the REAL entity, clipped to keep only the +entry_forward half (the part
--     that has NOT crossed yet) -- via a RenderOverride that pushes an
--     entry-plane clip.
--   * a clientside GHOST at the mirror-transformed exit pose, clipped to keep
--     only the +exit_forward half (the EMERGED part) -- a ClientsideModel the
--     engine auto-draws in every view (main scene AND each portal RT), with its
--     own RenderOverride pushing an exit-plane clip.
--
-- The 180-yaw mirror in wp.TransformPortalPos maps the +entry_forward half to
-- the -exit_forward half and vice versa, so the two kept halves are exact images
-- of each other under the transform: they tile the whole entity with a seam on
-- the portal plane (the same plane the teleport uses, portal:GetPos()).
--
-- This is a pure client-side VISUAL layer, deliberately decoupled from the
-- teleport logic: straddling is detected each frame by a geometry test, not by
-- when the teleport fires.
--
-- Phase 1: physics props (rigid -- a single SetPos/SetAngles poses the ghost).
-- Phase 2: skeletal entities -- ragdolls (physics-driven skeleton) and NPCs
-- (animated, sequence-driven skeleton). Their visible shape is the posed
-- skeleton, not a rigid transform, so a plain ClientsideModel of the model would
-- draw in its reference (T-)pose. We drive the ghost bone-by-bone instead: each
-- frame we read the real entity's world bone matrices and re-emit them through
-- the portal transform onto the ghost (see copyBonesThroughPortal). A held weapon
-- is a separate entity bone-merged onto the hands, so it's mirrored as a second
-- sub-ghost (see updateWeapon / makeWeaponGhostOverride). This covers props,
-- ragdolls, NPCs and players -- including the LOCAL player, whose ghost is their
-- emerged half at the exit, so the body reads as whole during transit. The local
-- player's ghost is suppressed only in the single view looking straight through
-- the portal they're transiting (see localGhostIsCutaway), where the camera sits

-- PreDrawOpaqueRenderables (so ghosts stay glued regardless), and GHOST_GRACE
-- (0.1s) comfortably outlives the gap, so a record seen on one scan survives until
-- the next. Running it at ~SCAN_HZ instead of the frame rate cuts the cost without

-- This is the right "portal off" signal because it is POSITION-INDEPENDENT: it
-- reads networked state (DoorOpen, vortex/redecorate flags, GetTracking,
-- custom-link part on/off) identically from any viewpoint. We deliberately do NOT
-- gate on wp-shouldrender: the exterior portal's ShouldRenderPortal returns false
-- once the camera is far from the exterior box (a TARDIS interior is thousands of
-- units away), so a render-gated ghost vanished the moment you stepped INSIDE --
-- even though the emerged half should still show through the interior portal. The
-- ghost is a world-space model at the exit; whether the entry portal's SURFACE
-- draws from the current eye is irrelevant to whether the ghost should exist.
--
-- Covers: closed door, TARDIS in the vortex (in flight), interior redecorating,
-- the prop being the TARDIS's towed/tracked entity, a custom-linked sub-door
-- switched off, and TardisParts. The downstream ShouldTeleportPortal handlers are
-- registered shared for the predicted player teleport and read networked state, so
-- this resolves on the client. nil = no veto = ghost. (A purely server-side veto --
-- e.g. tracking's constraint-set check -- can't be seen here, but erring toward
-- showing a ghost the server won't teleport is harmless: the prop never crosses
-- the plane, so its ghost stays fully clipped and invisible.)
